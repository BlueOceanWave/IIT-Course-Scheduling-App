## Problem Statement
Creating a schedule at Illinois Institute of Technology can be a hassle because of the vast amount of class options and requirements. The Illinois Tech Course Scheduling application simplifies the task for students by taking the classes the user has taken and recommending classes that are required and fit their schedule while also containing all the necessary information in one place.

## How It Started
As a group of students that attend IIT, we all had similar problems when it came to registering for classes. A common problem that we found is that it is hard to keep track of requirements, taken classes, available classes and which classes you have already registered for since each of these requires having a different tab open which leads to constantly switching between tabs. We decided to design and program a web application that keeps all this information in one simple spot. Another feature of this application is that it reccomends 5 classes that are available and that are still required for you to take. This application eliminates some of the hassle during registration time and minimizes the need of constant back and forth emails between stuudetns and professors as well as students and their advisor.

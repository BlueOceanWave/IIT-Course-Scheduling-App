# IPro 497 – Product Design Document

## Problem statement
Computer Science and Computer Engineering students at IIT will be able to plan their future semesters and be given recommendations based on their major and the courses they’ve already finished. 

 
## Customer
### Description
Computer Science or Computer Engineering students who are trying to create their schedule based on their major requirements 

Occupation: Undergrad/Grad Students 

### Other customer(s) or stakeholder(s)
IIT Administration 
 
## Application type (web app, mobile, website, native client, …)
Web Application
 
### Tech stack
Python, Django and Mysql <br>

#### Client Tech 
Internet Browser 
#### Server Tech
* Python
* Django
* MySQL Database

## Top Application Capabilities (name at least 5)
* Computer Science and Computer Engineering Students at IIT can select their major  
* Students can enter classes they’ve taken 
* Helps students track the number of credits they have earned and how many are remaining for graduation  
* App will list remaining required classes for degree 
* App will predict when classes will be offered (based on trends from previous semesters/professor promises) 
* App will recommend and help organize classes for future semesters (provide multiple possibilities in case of time conflicts) 
* Search function for looking up classes based on subject, professors, pre-requirements, etc.  
* Allows students to create an account to save their information, but not necessary 
* Incorporates a user-friendly interface allowing students to plan their academic journeys 


## Scenarios

1. A student is trying to plan for future semesters but is having trouble keeping track of completed courses, required courses, when courses may be offered, prerequisite courses, and all other things they need to worry about. The student then finds our website and can simply enter the classes they have taken and their major and find all this information in one organized spot so they can spend less time creating their schedule. 
2. A student is in their final year before they graduate but cannot find which classes they still need to take to graduate. Rather than spending time making a spreadsheet and possibly missing a class, they use our website.

## Team Working Agreement (All team members)
### What do we want to accomplish/learn together?

### Tools
#### Examples (edit and add your own)
- We will use Github for version control. Team-members will push their finished code to a branch to ensure the main branch remains bug-free.
- We will use Discord for out-of-class communication and meetings. 

### Requested Approach/Behavior 
##### Examples
- We will communicate respectfully and professionally; we will listen to each other's ideas and come to a consensus on what must be done. 
- Work will be fairly divided between each member of the team.  Each member will choose a fair number of stories from the Kanban board. 
- No changing an idea without discussion with the whole group. 
- If we disagree, we will either try to find a halfway point or vote on it as a group.
